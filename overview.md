## More details
The Parasoft Findings extension creates a post test-execution task that integrates your Azure DevOps project with Parasoft SOAtest 9.x functional test results and Parasoft C/C++test & Jtest unit test results. The task will collect test results from the Parasoft report XML, and display these results in the form of pass/fail indications and result details. The results can also be displayed as trending data in graph form, for additional analysis.
