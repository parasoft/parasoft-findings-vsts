# Parasoft Findings for Azure DevOps

The Parasoft Findings extension is designed to be used in a post test-execution build step that integrates functional and unit test reports generated by Parasoft tools into your Azure DevOps project. The task will collect test results from the Parasoft report XML files and display the number of passed/failed tests and result details. The results can also be displayed as trending data in a graph for a simple visualization.
