# Parasoft Findings for Azure DevOps

The Parasoft Findings extension is designed to be used in a post test-execution build step that integrates static analysis, functional and unit test reports generated by Parasoft tools into your Azure DevOps project. The task will collect static analysis and test results from the Parasoft report XML files.
- For test results, the number of passed/failed tests and result details will be displayed. Trending data in a graph for a simple visualization is also available.
- For static analysis results, this plugin has been integrated with the [SARIF SAST Scans Tab](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sariftools.scans) to visualize static analysis results. Navigation to rule documentation is also available.
